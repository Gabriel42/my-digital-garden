2025-09-01

A new month, a new school year and the perfect time to begin something fresh: this blog. I’ll be writing about my rediscovered hobby of TTRPGs.

It’s been years since I last played, but I remember fondly how, in my formative years, I loved to drain the blood of strangers on the street and hide their bodies. My favorite character was a child Malkavian vampire with a split personality. I liked to think of myself as a little Kirsten Dunst in Interview with the Vampire, but with one more personality.

Now that I’m diving back in, I keep asking myself: what should I write about? The TTRPG blogosphere is already packed with brilliant voices, funny, insightful, deeply researched, and endlessly creativity. Just last week I discovered [Chris McDowall’s blog](https://www.bastionland.com/) and almost lost myself in his years of posts. I’m not at that level (maybe one day a few decades from now), so instead I’ll embrace my noob status. I’ll write from the honest perspective of someone rediscovering the hobby and being constantly amazed by it. Hopefully, seeing this space through fresh eyes will make for something interesting to read.

Still, the blog needs a bit more substance. I’ve been reading a lot lately, including TTRPG books. Last year I went through Troyka, Dog Eat Dog, and Thousand Year Old Vampire. More recently I devoured Mythic Bastionland and immediately ran a one-shot with three friends. And while browsing the internet, I stumbled on the Humble Bundle “The Ultimate Guide to Tabletop RPGs, Worldbuilding, and Folklore”, a collection of 27 books. That gave me an idea: I’ll read them and share my impressions here.

Some ground rules: the Dungeonmeister books won’t be read cover to cover. I’ll dip into them, try a recipe here and there, maybe flip through the trivia book when the mood strikes. To keep things from feeling like homework, I’ll mix categories instead of plowing through six fantasy creature books in a row. Bigger categories, like the Ultimate RPG guides, will naturally show up more often.

I also plan to look into the authors themselves, because let’s be real, falling into 20 open Wikipedia tabs is half the fun. And in researching the people behind these books, I’ll probably discover even more fascinating material. It’s not like I’m short on reading, anyway.

So, without further ado, let’s roll a d8 to see which Ultimate RPG Guide comes first.

Rolled a 5. Ultimate RPG Character Backstory Guide: Expanded Genres Edition.

But wait… should I read the original edition first? Or just dive into the expanded one? Do I even need to read both? Time for some fun fun research.

I’ll be back with answers and opinions in the next post.
