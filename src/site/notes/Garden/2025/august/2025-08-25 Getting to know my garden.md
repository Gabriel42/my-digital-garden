Hello everyone who comes here. This is me creating a digital garden and seeing what this is all about.

I was inspired by [[Chris Mcdowall\|Chris Mcdowall]], the person who created [[Mythic Bastionland\|Mythic Bastionland]]. You can find his own blog [here](https://www.bastionland.com/).

Just wanted a place where I can try to grow something of my own and see what happens if I share it online with the whole world. I will mostly talk about game design I think. But will probably talk about movies and books too since I'm 

For everyone who is curious the timestamp is following the [[Obisidian\|Obisidian]] format of yyyy-mm-dd. Maybe I will create a note to explain this? Who knows. Still getting my head around how to structure all this.
